\chapter*{Acknowledgments}

First and foremost, I want to thank my supervisors Thomas Pock and Erich Kobler.
During the journey of writing this thesis, we had many fruitful discussions and their exceptional understanding of the matter helped me a great deal.
Further, I want to thank all other colleagues of mine at the Institute of Computer Graphics and Vision for making my time there not only interesting, but also fun.
Finally, I want to use this opportunity to thank my family, and especially my parents for enabling me to have such a carefree time of studying.
